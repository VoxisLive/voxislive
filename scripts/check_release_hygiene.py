"""Release hygiene gate for the public (open-source) Voxis repository.

Purpose
-------
The public GitHub repo ships the open-source desktop build and nothing else.
Anything outside its public top level (PUBLIC_TOPLEVEL below), and any live
secret (API keys, Stripe keys, private keys, the production host IP, the
device pepper, JWTs), must never be tracked. Those live only on the
maintainer's machine and the server; `.gitignore` keeps them out of the tree,
but a stray `git add` or a hard-coded constant can still leak them. This
script is the enforcing gate.

What it checks
--------------
1. Forbidden tracked paths   — no non-public file is tracked by git.
2. Secret content scan       — tracked text files carry no live credentials.
3. (optional) history scan   — the same secret patterns never appear in git
   history, AND no non-public path ever existed in history (a file committed
   once and later removed stays recoverable from the log). Consciously-accepted
   prior leaks are grandfathered via HISTORY_PATH_ALLOWLIST /
   HISTORY_PATH_ALLOWLIST_PREFIXES.

It is dependency-free (stdlib only) so it runs identically on the maintainer's
Windows box (pre-push hook) and in GitHub Actions (Ubuntu). Exit code is 0 when
clean, 1 on any violation — wire it into CI and a pre-push hook.

Private literals
----------------
Some forbidden strings are themselves sensitive (the production host IP, an
internal hostname) and must NOT be hard-coded into this public file. They are
loaded at runtime from sources that never enter the tree:
  * env var VOXIS_HYGIENE_EXTRA  — newline/comma separated literals
  * file  .git/voxis-hygiene-private — one literal per line ('#' comments OK)
CI can inject VOXIS_HYGIENE_EXTRA from a repository secret.

Usage
-----
    python scripts/check_release_hygiene.py            # scan the tracked tree
    python scripts/check_release_hygiene.py --history  # also scan git history
    python scripts/check_release_hygiene.py --staged   # scan only staged files
