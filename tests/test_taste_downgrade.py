"""The taste wall: when the free tier's Pro minutes run out, the session stops
GRACEFULLY and a card offers the free voice — it does not die mid-word, and it
does not swap engines under a live session.

The hot swap this replaces failed in the field in a way no assertion caught: the
UI said "Pro voice" while Piper was speaking, because two engines inside one
session require the interface and the audio to update in lockstep. The owner's
design (2026-07-13) makes that state unrepresentable — one session, one engine —
so what these tests pin is the ROUTING: who gets the wall card, who gets the
hard stop, and that the Pro voice is allowed to finish its sentence first.
