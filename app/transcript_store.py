"""Session transcript persistence + caption export.

Each translation session is saved as one JSON file under the user's
`transcripts/` directory. The JSON is the canonical record (timestamped,
bilingual where a source transcription was captured); TXT / SRT / VTT are
rendered on demand from it.

Wire format (schema v1):

    {
      "version": 1,
      "started": 1718700000.0,          # epoch seconds (session start)
      "started_iso": "2026-06-18T12:00:00",
      "app_version": "x.y.z",
      "mode": "video" | "meeting" | "",
      "ui_language": "tr",
      "target_in": "tr",                # incoming target language code
      "target_out": "en",               # outgoing target language code
      "turns": [
        {"t": 0.0, "dir": "out", "src": "original ...", "text": "translated ...",
         "spk": 1},
        ...
      ]
    }

`t` is the turn's offset in seconds from session start. The translate model is
natively simultaneous and stays a few seconds behind the speaker, so `t` is an
approximate caption sync, not a frame-accurate cue — adequate for SRT/VTT.

`spk` (optional, additive to schema v1) is the anonymous speaker label from the
local speaker-change tracker (1-based session-scoped int; see app/speaker_id).
Exports render it as a language-neutral "S1:"/"S2:" prefix — only when the
session actually saw more than one speaker, so single-voice transcripts stay
clean.

`leg` (optional, additive) is the meeting direction a turn belongs to —
"incoming" (the other party, translated for the user) or "outgoing" (the user,
translated for the other party). Written only in meeting mode, so a Video/Game
record carries no `leg` at all and renders exactly as it always did. Exports
prefix every turn of a two-way record with the localized side name, because in
a meeting the sides alternate constantly and an omitted tag would read as "same
side as before" precisely when it is not.

# fields, a turn count and an 80-char preview. Parsing is cheap once the file is
# in the page cache (~0.06 ms each) -- the cost is the per-file OPEN on a cold
# one, which on Windows also drags in the AV filter: measured 14 ms per file, so
# the first History open after launch grew linearly with session count (~1 s at
# 68 sessions, ~7 s at the 500-file prune cap, scanned for BOTH the active and
# legacy dirs).
#
# The cache is therefore PERSISTED: an in-process dict alone would still pay the
# full cold cost on the first open of every launch, which is the case that
# actually hurts. Revalidation is (mtime_ns, size) from os.stat -- directory
# metadata, not a file open, so it does not re-trigger the scan. Any problem with
