"""Gemini Live translation session (the default engine).

gemini-3.5-live-translate-preview: 16 kHz PCM16 in → 24 kHz PCM16 out, one
direction per session. Meeting mode opens two instances. The 15-minute audio
session ceiling is handled by rotating the connection ahead of that limit
(rotate_minutes, plus a hard deadline so the ceiling is never missed even
mid-speech). Each instance owns an asyncio loop on its own thread.

The translate model is a native simultaneous interpreter: fed the continuous
stream it translates as the speaker talks and self-balances quality vs sync, so
the client sends NO realtime_input_config and lets the model own its endpointing.

The reconnect/rotation/watchdog machine is shared with the Qwen engine in
app/base_translator.py; only the Gemini SDK specifics — the
context-manager connection, the config, session resumption + GoAway handling —
live here. This module also owns the process-wide usage accumulator that every
engine funnels into (get_usage / _add_usage).
