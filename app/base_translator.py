"""Shared session machine for every realtime translation engine.

Both engines — Gemini Live (SDK) and Qwen3.5-LiveTranslate (raw websockets) —
run the SAME field-hardened lifecycle: a bounded drop-oldest input queue,
carryover across a planned rotation, backoff-bounded reconnect with
transient/terminal classification, a covert-immediate-close guard, and two
watchdogs (stall on sent-audio-with-no-server-events, and no-output-despite-
input). That machinery lived copy-pasted in multiple files and drifted (see
the 2026-07-04 audit P0 #6); it now lives here once.

Subclass contract — a concrete engine supplies only its protocol:
  * class attrs: HARD_ROTATE_SECONDS, IN_BYTES_PER_SEC (usage divisor),
    TERMINAL_PHRASES, READY_ON_CONNECT (True = _ready fires the moment the
    connection opens, as Gemini/Qwen do; False = the receiver sets it on a
    server 'session live' event instead, for an engine whose protocol
    requires waiting for one).
  * async _connect(self) -> raw connection (websocket engines only; the base
    wraps it in a close-on-exit context manager). Gemini overrides _session_cm
    instead, since its connection IS an async context manager (the SDK).
  * async _open_session(self, conn): send any post-connect config (websocket
    session.update). No-op for Gemini (config is bundled into connect()).
  * async _sender_frame(self, conn, item): send ONE input frame, then call
    self._account_sent(len(item)) for usage/stall accounting.
  * async _receive_loop(self, conn): parse the server event stream, calling the
    shared helpers _reset_stall / _mark_input / _mark_output, self.on_audio /
    self.on_text, self._record_usage("out_sec", …), and raising _Rotate on a
    GoAway. Gemini-only resume-handle capture lives here too.
  * optional hooks: _reset_session_state (reset per-connection parse state),
    _reset_reconnect_state (drop state that must not survive a failed reconnect,
    e.g. Gemini's stale resume handle).

The behavior constants below are the pre-consolidation values; each engine keeps
its own via class attrs. They are NOT tuning knobs to revisit here.
