"""Voxis DSP / mix core — psychoacoustic processing of the translation (TTS)
output chain.

Scope: in driverless session-ducking mode Voxis owns only its own TTS buffer
(the original ambient audio is reduced at the source by Windows and plays
directly), so ambient EQ / delay cannot be applied there. The components below:

  * LookaheadLimiter — look-ahead brickwall limiter on the Gemini TTS output.
                       Prevents 0 dBFS overshoot, which eliminates digital
                       clipping and TTS time-stretch distortion.
  * place_center     — places mono TTS in a phantom-center (equal L/R) image.
  * DelayLine        — fractional-read circular delay line. Wired but dormant;
                       activated only on the passthrough (VB-CABLE) path when
                       ambient audio is available.

The actual TTS+ambient summing lives in audio_io._mix_to_stereo, which composes
these primitives inside the output callback. (A PsychoMixer class that composed
them with an extra 1–4 kHz presence carve was removed: nothing outside this
module's own smoke-test block ever constructed it, and app/dsp.py existed solely
to supply its biquads.)

float32, block-continuous state (no boundary clicks). numpy is already sub-ms at
this block size — no native code.
