"""pywebview bridge between the web UI and the Python audio engine.

JavaScript invokes Bridge methods through `window.pywebview.api`; the UI polls
`poll()` to drain status, translation and telemetry events — every 70 ms while
a session is live (the caption is the fastest user-visible signal, so the poll
cadence is part of the latency budget), relaxing to 250 ms when idle.

        WHY THIS THREAD EXISTS: pywebview's EdgeChromium evaluate_js is
        SYNCHRONOUS -- it Invokes onto the WebView2 UI thread and blocks the
        caller on a semaphore until the script has run and its result marshalled
        back (webview/platforms/edgechromium.py). _put_event used to call it
        inline, so every caption token blocked whichever thread produced it.

        That thread is the translator's receive loop, and it is the SAME loop
        that hands us translated audio: Gemini alternates audio and text parts in
        one `async for` (translator.py `_receive_loop`), and Qwen dispatches
        `response.audio.delta` and `response.audio_transcript.delta` from one
        `async for` too (qwen_translator.py). So a busy or slow JS frame delayed
        the NEXT audio chunk reaching the stager and the Player ring -- and Qwen
        is realtime-paced, meaning that ring runs with essentially no headroom
        (the 180 ms prefill in audio_io.Player exists precisely because of it).
        Gemini delivers a turn faster than realtime and could absorb the stall;
        Qwen could not. Cascade differs again -- its audio comes off a separate
        synth thread -- but the same block delayed sentences reaching that
        thread's queue.

        Everything here is therefore off the audio path. Ordering is preserved

        wall — but an explicit one. The first design swapped engines under the
        live session, and in the field the owner heard the chip say "Pro voice"
        while Piper was speaking: with two engines inside one session, the UI and
        the audio can disagree. This design makes that state impossible: one
        session, one engine. The Pro voice finishes its sentence, the session
        stops, and a card asks whether to continue on the free voice — with the
        same last sentence replayable in BOTH voices, so the user hears exactly
        what they are choosing between (owner's design, 2026-07-13). "Continue"
        starts a NEW session, which the server routes to the cascade from the
        first frame — a path that runs in production already.

        The hard stop remains for everyone else: paid accounts out of minutes,
        Meeting mode, a disabled cascade, a spent daily allowance.

        Three walls, not two. A 402 arriving while the CASCADE is the live engine
        can only be the daily allowance: the server's cascade heartbeat path never
        compares against the license quota at all (handlers/usage.go), it only
        books against the 10-min/day counter. Reading the engine — rather than the
        quota flags — is what tells the two apart, so someone already on the free
        voice is told "today's free minutes are up, they come back tomorrow"
        instead of being offered the free voice they are currently listening to
        (owner report, 2026-07-13).

        smooth, monotonic (x,y) targets reached this method every ~16ms -- but

        gtk_window_move() on an already-mapped/shown window, or honor it only
        partially -- exactly this). `begin_move_drag` hands the ENTIRE
        gesture to Mutter's native `_NET_WM_MOVERESIZE`, which is the only
        path that actually respects real screen/multi-monitor edges and
        doesn't fight anything else. No-op while maximized, matching
