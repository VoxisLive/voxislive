"""Adaptive translated-speech playback pacing.

Translation providers can deliver a long spoken turn faster than realtime.  If
those samples are pushed straight into :class:`audio_io.Player`, the unplayed
tail grows while the source video continues, so spoken translation drifts
farther behind the already-visible captions.  This module bounds that playback
backlog and time-compresses speech with WSOLA, preserving pitch.

It deliberately sits *after* the provider: it cannot shorten the model's
first-audio delay, but it can drain audio that has already arrived without
changing provider prompts, endpointing, or generated text.
