"""Optional dual-track session recorder.

Writes the SOURCE audio and the TRANSLATED audio as two SEPARATE WAV files
(never a single mix), so a user can compare the two, re-mix, or reuse the
translated track for dubbing / video editing — Ivo's localization request.

Opt-in (cfg['record_audio'], default OFF) on purpose: the source track captures
real human voice, a consent/biometric step up over a text transcript, whereas
the translated track is our own synthetic TTS. Recording only happens while a
session is active and the user has turned it on — and ONLY in Video/Game mode.
Meeting mode never records: there the source is another person's live voice, and
recording it without consent is legally fraught (all-party-consent regimes), so
the pipeline skips the recorder in that mode regardless of the toggle.

Streams straight to disk via stdlib `wave` (no whole-session memory buffer).
Thread-safe by track: source frames arrive on the capture-callback thread and
translated frames on the translator/stager thread, so each track owns its lock
and writer. A disk fault stops recording quietly — it must never break the live
translation session.
