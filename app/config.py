# list falls back to its DEFAULTS value, so secrets (qwen_key / any *_key),
# machine-specific device names, window geometry, hotkey customizations,
# _pending_* recovery state and the beta/qwen opt-in can never leak into the
# bundle. This is the allowlist half of P0 #8; the build script adds a
# fail-closed secret scan on top.
#   capture_backend is included but is auto-resolved by premium on the official
#   build (pipeline.resolve_capture_backend), falling back to driverless, so a
#   seeded "vbcable" is harmless on a machine without a virtual cable.
